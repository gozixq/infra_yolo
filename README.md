# Predict Animal from Image Using YOLO
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to predict animals in images. The project includes an image uploader where users can either upload a picture or provide a link to an image, and the YOLO model will process the image to detect and identify animals.

# Features
- Image Upload: Users can upload an image from their device or provide a URL link to an image.

- Real-time Animal Detection: The system utilizes a YOLO pre-trained model to detect animals in the uploaded image.

- Fast and Accurate: YOLO is a fast, state-of-the-art object detection system that predicts bounding boxes and classifies objects in one pass, providing efficient animal detection.

# How It Works
1. Upload or Provide a Link: Users can upload an image file or paste a URL to an image in the web application.
2. Image Processing: The image is processed using the YOLO model, which predicts bounding boxes and labels for any animals detected in the image.
3. View Results: After processing, the user can see the detected animal(s) and their corresponding bounding boxes drawn on the image.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Required for running the application.
Python: Required if you are setting up YOLO in a backend environment.
Docker: To run the app in a containerized environment.
